## Short Bio
I am currently a software design engineer for Digital Signal Processing ([DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing)) projects. I've hands-on experience with C, C++ and Python. I'm passionately interested in Graph Neural Networks ([GNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network)) and their characteristics on GPGPUs.
